# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Project Description Started Now

Date: 17-05-2024

Step-1: SetUp of React Application is done successfully.

Step-2: Git initialization:

            a. git config --global user.email "rakeshranjan804432@gmail.com"

            b. git config --global user.name "rakesh ranjan kumar"

            c. git init

            e. git remote add origin https://github.com/RAKESH9798/Rakesh_Portfolio.git

                        To change the remote repository in Git, you need to update the URL of the remote repository associated with your local repository. Here's how you can do it:

                        1. **Check the Current Remote URL**:
                        First, verify the current remote URL by running:
                        ```bash
                        git remote -v
                        ```
                        This will display the current remote repositories and their URLs.

                        2. **Change the Remote URL**:
                        You can change the remote URL using the `git remote set-url` command. Replace `origin` with the name of your remote (if it's different) and `new_url` with the new repository URL.
                        ```bash
                        git remote set-url origin new_url
                        ```

                        3. **Verify the Change**:
                        After changing the URL, you can verify it by running:
                        ```bash
                        git remote -v
                        ```
                        This should show the updated remote URL.

                        
                        ### Additional Commands

                        - **Add a New Remote**:
                        If you want to add a new remote instead of changing the existing one:
                        ```bash
                        git remote add new-origin new_url
                        ```

                        - **Remove an Existing Remote**:
                        To remove a remote repository:
                        ```bash
                        git remote remove origin
                        ```

                        These steps should help you change the remote repository URL in your Git configuration.

            f. git add -A

            g. git commit -m "First Commit"

            h. git branch -M main
